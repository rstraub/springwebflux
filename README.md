# springwebflux

This project is mainly to try out some reactive *Spring WebFlux* stuff.
As a database the application uses MongoDb with the reactive Mongo driver, together with Spring Data.
In doing so, I also decided to build it completely with *Kotlin*.
For testing the project uses *jUnit 5* with *Mockito*.
The project is built using *Gradle*.
